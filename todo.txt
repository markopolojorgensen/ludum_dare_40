Compo or Jam?
  probably Jam


The more money you have, the more you get sued?
The more disease/hatred/death/problems/etc
The more twitch viewers you have
    banning people
    adding new cursewords to the block list
    writing new chatbots
    banners and stuff






orisinal
  autumn leaves or some stupid name like that
    last station repair the train / spaceteam vibe


Tower defense? NO
top down / sidescroller? Top Down?

The more leaves you have, the worse it is
  higher % of ground cover -> more wind
    eventually you get blown away by the wind

trees plant more trees
  helicopter seeds / acorns / etc
  more trees -> more leaves -> more work for you
  there are monsters in the leaves?

something something coinbox hero
  rediculous weapons prevent leaves from hitting the ground
    laser turrets
    machine gun turrets
    paratrooping squirrels?
    flamethrower?
    rake
      swinging rake around generates a whirlwind that does something
        chargeable move
    wind comes through periodically and scatters piles if you don't scoop them up










The more you have, the worse it is.
LEAF WARDEN
  Compo
    X always rake towards the middle
    X can't move as fast when charging or firing laser
    X leaf raked velocity should be slightly randomized
    X too many leaves loses the game
    X you lost banner
    X game start banner
    bug: needing to repress movement keys
    re-autostart the music
    rake sfx
    laser charge sfx
    laser sfx
    music: bigger silence gaps for wind appreciation
    music: don't filter lead during intro, wait for bass
    leaf spawn rate changes over time
    laser charge proportional to leaf count
    leaves periodically stop falling
    wind fade out / in
    wind speed increases with leaf presence
    leaf overhaul (more saturation / contrast with ground)
    leaf shadows should be lighter, especially when leaf is high off the ground
    game over wind should pick up grounded leaves



  music
    longer track
    pad
    more percussion?
  uncat
    speed powerups?
    X git repo
  leaves
    X leaves fall to the ground
    X leaf shadow shows where it will hit the ground
    X multiple leaves fall at the same time
    X leaves need to not fall up forever
    X leaves need to not fall outside the window horizontally
    X leaf counter shows how many leaves there are
    leaves re-pick destination when wrapping around the screen?
    leaves have a transition to their starting position
    leaf falling velocity variability varies proportionally to the wind speed (???)
    don't wrap leaves when being raked
  player
    X player can move
    X player can rake
    velocity lerp
    probably should have a frowny face while they get buried by leaves
  rake
    X raking moves leaves
    X can't rake while raking
    rake in any direction
    can't move while raking
  laser
    X charge up by holding rake button
    X fires a giant laser
    X deletes leaves in vertical line
    maximum distance
    laser in any direciton
    strafe while charging or firing (can't look in a different direction)
  leaf piles
    raking enough leaves together does something
  wind
    X wind blows falling leaves around
    X wind sound effect
    wind sound effect increases with leaf presence
    wind has a chance to blow grounded leaves back into the air
      chance increases with wind speed
    wind blows vertically as well as horizontally?
  arena
    X sweet zen garden
    X sweet zen garden rock thing
