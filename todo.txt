  probably Jam


The more money you have, the more you get sued?
The more disease/hatred/death/problems/etc
The more twitch viewers you have
    banning people
    adding new cursewords to the block list
    writing new chatbots
    banners and stuff






orisinal
  autumn leaves or some stupid name like that
    last station repair the train / spaceteam vibe


Tower defense? NO
top down / sidescroller? Top Down?

The more leaves you have, the worse it is
  higher % of ground cover -> more wind
    eventually you get blown away by the wind

trees plant more trees
  helicopter seeds / acorns / etc
  more trees -> more leaves -> more work for you
  there are monsters in the leaves?

something something coinbox hero
  rediculous weapons prevent leaves from hitting the ground
    laser turrets
    machine gun turrets
    paratrooping squirrels?
    flamethrower?
    rake
      swinging rake around generates a whirlwind that does something
        chargeable move
    wind comes through periodically and scatters piles if you don't scoop them up










The more you have, the worse it is.
LEAF WARDEN
  Compo
    X always rake towards the middle
    X can't move as fast when charging or firing laser
    X leaf raked velocity should be slightly randomized
    X too many leaves loses the game
    X you lost banner
    X game start banner
    X bug: needing to repress movement keys
    X leaves periodically stop falling
    X wind fade out / in
    X more leaves -> shorter break
    X music: bigger silence gaps for wind appreciation
    X music: don't filter lead during intro, wait for bass
    X rake sfx
    X laser charge sfx
    X laser sfx
    X display score on game over
    X screen shake
    X too many leaves gauge
    X display respite time to user
    X re-autostart the music
    X leaf spawn rate changes over time

    X leaf counter shows how many leaves there are
    leaves re-pick destination when wrapping around the screen?
    leaves have a transition to their starting position
    leaf falling velocity variability varies proportionally to the wind speed (???)
    don't wrap leaves when being raked

    X player can move

    raking enough leaves together does something
  wind
    X wind blows falling leaves around
